Qualification System: Lead Scoring

Phase 5.2 from tasks10.md

This module implements the lead scoring system for the Lead Qualification
Agent competition. It combines:

1. Automatic-zero pre-checks (deterministic validation)
2. LLM-based scoring for three components:
   - ICP Fit (0-20 points)
   - Decision Maker (0-30 points)
   - Intent Signal (0-50 points, with time decay)
3. Penalties for cost and time
4. Final score calculation

Scoring Flow:
1. Run pre-checks → If fail, score = 0
2. Mark company as seen (first lead per company wins)
3. Score ICP fit via LLM
4. Score decision maker via LLM
5. Verify intent signal and score relevance via LLM
6. Apply time decay to intent signal
7. Calculate penalties
8. Compute final score (floor at 0)

Max Score per Lead: 100 points (20 + 30 + 50)

CRITICAL: This is NEW scoring for qualification models only.
Do NOT modify any existing scoring or reputation calculation in the
sourcing workflow.

    Score a lead against an ICP.
    
    This is the main entry point for lead scoring. The flow is:
    
    1. Run automatic-zero pre-checks (BEFORE any LLM calls)
    2. If pre-checks fail → return score 0 immediately with failure_reason
    3. If pre-checks pass → mark company as seen, run LLM scoring
    
    Scoring Components:
    - ICP Fit: 0-20 pts (how well lead matches ICP criteria)
    - Decision Maker: 0-30 pts (is this person a buyer/decision maker)
    - Intent Signal: 0-50 pts (quality and relevance of intent signal)
    
    Time Decay:
    - ≤2 months old: 100% (multiplier 1.0)
    - ≤12 months old: 50% (multiplier 0.5)
    - >12 months old: 25% (multiplier 0.25)
    
    Variability Penalties (NEW - replaces old linear penalties):
    - NO penalty if cost ≤ average ($0.05) and time ≤ average (8s)
    - 5-point penalty if cost > 2× average ($0.10)
    - 5-point penalty if time > 2× average (16s)

SCORING GUIDELINES:
- 40-50: Signal directly proves the company matches the buyer's request (e.g., buyer wants "companies ramping up managed IT" and signal shows new IT partnerships)
- 30-39: Signal strongly suggests the company fits (e.g., hiring for roles related to what buyer is selling)
- 20-29: Signal is somewhat relevant but indirect
- 10-19: Tangentially related, weak connection to what the buyer wants
- 0-9: Signal exists but has no meaningful connection to the buyer's request

IMPORTANT: Penalize generic descriptions. Examples of LOW scores:
- "Company is actively operating in X industry" → 0-5 (too generic)
- "Visible market activity" → 0-5 (no specific intent)
- Vague descriptions without specific actions → max 10

Consider:
1. Does this signal match what the buyer specifically asked for?
2. Does it show evidence of the SPECIFIC intent the buyer described (e.g., "ramping up offerings", "expanding dev teams", "undergoing digital transformation")?
3. Would a salesperson use this signal to pitch "{icp.product_service}" to this company?
4. Is the description specific or generic/templated?
